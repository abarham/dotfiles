2016-05-13 13:54:38	dfk921	a = 0, a + a = -a, -a + -a = b
2016-05-13 13:54:47	randomly	in case of: (x^2 + 1) = y and x + 1 = y
2016-05-13 13:54:53	randomly	can x and y have more than one solution

2016-05-13 13:55:11	randomly	yes because x^2 + 1 = y is nonlinear right?

2016-05-13 13:56:03	mxms	look at the intersections
2016-05-13 13:56:12	Millennial	mxms alternatively, solve x^2 - x = 0
2016-05-13 13:56:14	Millennial	which is easier
2016-05-13 13:56:20	mxms	they either: intersect at one point, intersect at two points, or not at all
2016-05-13 13:56:26	mxms	well, yeah Millennial ;p

2016-05-13 13:57:20	harrynoob	Millennial: oh, cool. f has trivial kernel, G is finite. f must be an iso-endomorphism
2016-05-13 13:57:27	harrynoob	now on to the actual abelian part!
