2016-05-13 11:51:45	TheAnachron	All I need to do now is to know how to make netctl start the right wpa_supplicant service (with the right config) and shutdown when I dont use the network anymore.

2016-05-13 11:52:47	MacGyver	kriskropd: But yeah, the md5sum mismatch of the modules are a problem.
2016-05-13 11:52:59	thurstylark	teraflops: badly
2016-05-13 11:53:12	MacGyver	kriskropd: Probably had some corruption on your /boot fs.
